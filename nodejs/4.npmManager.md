#### An Introduction to the npm package manager

##### Introduction to npm

npm is the standard package manager for Node.js.

> yarn and pnpm are alrternatives to npm cli.

##### Packages

npm installs, updates and manages downloads of dependencies of your project. Dependencies are pre-built pieces of code, such as libraries and packages, that your Node.js application needs to work.

##### Installing all dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

it will install everyting the project needs, in the node_modules folder, creating it if it's not existing already.

##### Installing a single Package

you can also install a specific package by running.

```sh
npm install <package_name>
```

often you'll see more flags added to this command.

- --save-dev [-D] installs and add the entry to the package.json file *devDependencies*
-  --no-dev installs but does not add the entry to the package.json file *depedencies*
-  --save-optional [-O] installs and adds the entry to the package.json file *optionlDependencies*
-  --no-optional will prevent optional dependencies from being installed.

##### Versioning

you can install a specific version of a package, by running.

```sh
npm install <package_name>@version
```

##### Running Task

The package.json file supports a format for specifying command line tasks that can be run by using

```sh
npm run <task_name>
```

for example

```json
{
    "scripts":{
        "start-dev" : "node lib/server-development",
        "start" : "node lib/server-production"
    }
}
```
