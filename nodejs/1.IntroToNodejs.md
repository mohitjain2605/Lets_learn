### Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 Javascript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

### Summary of Node.js

- **Open-Source and Cross-Platform**: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- **V8 JavaScript Engine**: It runs the V8 engine from Google Chrome outside the browser, enhancing performance.
- **Single Process Model**: Node.js apps run in a single process without creating new threads for each request.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Provides asynchronous I/O primitives to prevent blocking, with non-blocking paradigms being the norm.
- **Efficient I/O Operations**: Handles I/O operations efficiently by resuming operations upon response, avoiding CPU cycle wastage.
- **Concurrency Handling**: Manages thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without thread concurrency issues.
- **JavaScript for Frontend and Backend**: Allows frontend developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, eliminating the need to learn a new language.
- **ECMAScript Standards**: Supports new ECMAScript standards and allows enabling experimental features by changing Node.js versions or using flags.
