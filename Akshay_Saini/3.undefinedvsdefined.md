# Undefined vs Defined

In JavaScript, they both are related to memory space and there is a very simple difference between them. If the variable name which is being accessed doesn’t exist in memory space then it would be not defined, and if exists in memory space but hasn’t been assigned any value till now, then it would be undefined.

Example:

```js
console.log(a) // undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a) // 10
console.log(x) // not defined or Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

JavaScript is considered a loosely typed or dynamically typed language because variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular data type. This means that a variable can hold any type of value at any time. Here are some key points:

1. **No Type Declaration**: You do not need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it.
2. **Type Coercion**: JavaScript automatically converts between types when necessary. For example, it can convert a string to a number if the context requires it.
3. **Dynamic Typing**: The type of a variable can change during the execution of a program. For example, a variable that initially holds a number can later be assigned a string.

Example:

```js
let x = 10; // x is a number
console.log(x) // 10
x = "Hello"; // now x is a string
console.log(x) // Hello
x = true; // now x is a boolean
console.log(x) // true
```

*This flexibility can make JavaScript easier to work with but can also lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed.*
