#### Function Statement

Function statement and function Declaration both are same.

```js
a(); // function a can be hoisteed

function a() {
    console.log("a called");
}
```

#### Function expression

```js
const b = function() {
        console.log("b called)
        }

        b(); // here, you can't call b before declaration.
        //  b can not be hosited it will throw typoError
```

#### Function Declaration

Function statement and function Declaration both are same.

#### Anonymous Function

```js
function() {

} // this won't work as it is not assinged to some variable
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name
// here is a catch above function can be pass as an argument and it is valid. you can see example in first call function

const anonFunc = function() {
    console.log("Anonymous function called");
};

anonFunc(); // This works because the function is assigned to a variable.
```

#### Named Function

```js
var z = function xyz() {
    console.log("name called");
}
z();
// xyz(); // it won't work as xyz do not exist in memory
```

#### Different between Parameters & Arguments ?

* Parameters:

  + Parameters are the placeholders or variables defined in the function declaration or definition.
  + They act as labels to receive the values passed to the function when it is called.
  + Here, param1 and param2 are parameters.
* Arguments:

  + Arguments are the actual values or data passed to the function when it is called.
  + These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function.
  + Here, 1 and 2 are arguments.
 

```js
const b = function(param1, param2) {
        console.log("b called)
        }

        b(1, 2);
```

#### first class Function

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they are treated like any other value. This allows functions to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. it is Ability to be used like values. it is also called First class Citizens
* Passing Functions as Arguments

```js
function executeCallback(callback) {
    callback();
}

executeCallback(function() {
    console.log("Callback executed!"); // this is the anonynmous function which is used as an arguments
});
```

#### Arrow Function
